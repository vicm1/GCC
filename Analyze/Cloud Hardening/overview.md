In this activity, you will be presented with a scenario about a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address the breach, you will identify some common network hardening tools that can be implemented to protect the organization’s overall security. Then, you will select a specific vulnerability that the company has and propose different network hardening methods. Finally, you will explain how the methods and tools you chose will be effective for managing the vulnerability and how they will prevent potential breaches in the future. 

In the course, you learned network hardening and network security-related hardening practices, such as port filtering, network access privileges, and encryption over networks. Network hardening practices help organizations monitor potential threats and attacks on their network and prevent some attacks from occurring. Some hardening practices are implemented every day, while others are executed every once in a while, such as every other week or once a month. Understanding how to use network hardening tools and methods will help you better monitor network activity and protect your organization’s network against various attacks.
