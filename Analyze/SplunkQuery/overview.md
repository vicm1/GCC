So far, you've learned that SIEM tools, such as Splunk, are an important part of a security analyst's toolbox because they provide a platform for storing, analyzing, and reporting on data from different sources. You also explored some basic searches using Splunk's querying language, called Search Processing Language (SPL), which included the use of pipes and wildcards.

Creating effective searches is an important skill because it enables you to quickly and accurately find the information you are looking for within a large amount of data. Quick and accurate searching is especially useful during incident response, because you might need to swiftly identify and address a security incident. Effective search techniques also help you efficiently identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within data.
