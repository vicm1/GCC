In this activity, you will assess the attack vectors of a USB drive. You will consider a scenario of finding a USB drive in a parking lot from both the perspective of an attacker and a target.

USBs, or flash drives, are commonly used for storing and transporting data. However, some characteristics of these small, convenient devices can also introduce security risks. Threat actors frequently use USBs to deliver malicious software, damage other hardware, or even take control of devices. USB baiting is an attack in which a threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install to unknowingly infect a network. It relies on curious people to plug in an unfamiliar flash drive that they find.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
