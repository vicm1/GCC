You’re a security analyst at an investment firm called Imaginary Bank. An executive at the firm recently received a spear phishing email that appears to come from the board of Imaginary Bank. Spear phishing is a malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source. In this case, the executive is being asked to install new collaboration software, ExecuTalk.

The executive suspects this email might be a phishing attempt because ExecuTalk was never mentioned during the last board meeting. They've forwarded the message to your team to verify if it’s legitimate. Your supervisor has tasked you with investigating the message and determining whether it should be quarantined.
