Our application should seamlessly connect sellers and shoppers. It should be easy for users to sign-up, log in, and manage their accounts.
Data privacy is a big concern for us. We want users to feel confident that weâ€™re being responsible with their information.
Buyers should be able to directly message sellers with questions. They should also have the ability to rate sellers
to encourage good service. Sales should be clear and quick to process. Users should have several payment options for a
smooth checkout process. Proper payment handling is really important because we want to avoid legal issues.

Application programming interface (API): An API is a set of rules that define how software components interact with each other.
In application development, third-party APIs are commonly used to add functionality without having to program it from scratch.

Public key infrastructure (PKI): PKI is an encryption framework that secures the exchange of online information. The mobile app
uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms: AES and RSA. AES encryption is used to encrypt sensitive data,
such as credit card information. RSA encryption is used to exchange keys between the app and a user's device.

SHA-256: SHA-256 is a commonly used hash function that takes an input of any length and produces a digest of 256 bits. The sneaker
app will use SHA-256 to protect sensitive user data, like passwords and credit card numbers.

Structured query language (SQL): SQL is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a
database. For example, the mobile app uses SQL to store information about the sneakers that are for sale, as well as the sellers
who are selling them. It also  uses SQL to access that data during a purchase.
