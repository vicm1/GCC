Previously, you discussed how the Bash shell helps you communicate with a computer’s operating system.

When you communicate with the shell, the commands in the shell can take input and return output or error messages.

In this lab activity, you’ll use the echo command to examine how input is received and how output is returned in the shell. Next, you’ll use the expr command to further explore input and output while performing some basic calculations in the shell.

This activity will build foundations in understanding how you communicate with the Linux operating system through the shell. As a security analyst, you'll need to input commands into the shell and recognize when the shell returns either output or an error message.
