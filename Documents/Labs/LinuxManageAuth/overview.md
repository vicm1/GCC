In this lab activity, you’ll use Linux commands to configure authorization.

Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. It's important because without authorization any user could access and modify all files belonging to other users or system files. This would certainly be a security risk.

In Linux, file and directory permissions are used to specify who has access to specific files and directories. You’ll explore file and directory permissions and change the ownership of a file and a directory to limit who can access them.

As a security analyst, setting appropriate access permissions is critical to protecting sensitive information and maintaining the overall security of a system.
