You are a security analyst who is responsible for writing code that will automate analysis of login attempts made to a specific device. As the first step, you'll need to create variables to keep track of information relevant to the login process. This information includes the device ID, list of approved usernames, maximum login attempts allowed per user, current login attempts made by a user, and login status.

Throughout this lab, you'll assign these variables and check the data types of the variables.
