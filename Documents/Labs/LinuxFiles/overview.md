Previously, you learned about Linux and how to communicate with the OS through the shell. You also learned how to use some of the core commands to navigate the Linux file system and read content from files it contains.

These are essential skills. For example, when investigating unauthorized access, you might navigate to and then read a user access report.

In this lab activity, you’ll navigate a Linux file structure, locate files, and read the contents of files. You’ll also need to answer a few multiple-choice questions based on the information contained in these files.

As a security analyst, it’s key that you know how to navigate, manage, and analyze files remotely via a Linux shell without a graphical user interface.
