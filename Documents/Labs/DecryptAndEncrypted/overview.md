Previously, you learned about cryptography and how encryption and decryption can be used to secure information online. You were also introduced to the Caesar cipher, one of the earliest cryptographic algorithms used to protect people’s privacy.

As a security analyst, it’s important that you understand the role of encryption to secure data online and that you’re familiar with the right security controls to do so.

In this lab activity, you’ll be guided through some basic cryptographic activities using Linux commands to decrypt files and reveal hidden messages.
