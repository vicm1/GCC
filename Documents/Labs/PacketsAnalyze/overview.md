As a security analyst, you’ll need to analyze network traffic in order to learn what type of traffic is being sent to and from systems on the networks you’ll be working with.

Previously, you learned about packet capture and analysis. Analyzing packets can help security teams interpret and understand network communications. Network protocol analyzers such as Wireshark, which has a graphical user interface or GUI, can help you examine packet data during your investigations. Since network packet data is complex, network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers) like Wireshark are designed to help you find patterns and filter the data in order to focus on the network traffic that is most relevant to your security investigations.

Now you’ll use Wireshark to inspect packet data and apply filters to sort through packet information efficiently.

In this lab activity, you’ll use Wireshark to examine a sample packet capture file and filter the network traffic data.
