An important part of cybersecurity is controlling access to restricted content. In this lab, you'll work with a text file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access specific restricted content at your organization.

Parsing a file allows security analysts to read and update the contents. Python helps analysts develop algorithms to automate the process of parsing files and keeping them up-to-date.

You'll develop an algorithm that parses this text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing that addresses that no longer have access to the restricted content.
