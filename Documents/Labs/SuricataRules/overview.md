Previously, you learned about packet analysis and the basic syntax and components of intrusion detection systems (IDS) signatures and rules. You also learned how to examine a prewritten signature and its log output in Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

In this lab activity, you’ll explore more about Suricata alerts and logs, including the general process of rule creation.

The Suricata tool monitors network interfaces and applies rules to the packets that pass through the interface. Suricata determines whether each packet should generate an alert and be dropped, rejected, or allowed to pass through the interface.

Source and destination networks must be specified in the Suricata configuration. Custom rules can be written to specify which traffic should be processed.

You’ll examine a rule and practice using Suricata to trigger alerts on network traffic. You’ll also analyze log outputs, such as a fast.log and eve.json file. This will help you understand some of the alerts and logs generated by Suricata.
